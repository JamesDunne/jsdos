OS:

assume 64-bit

kernel:
    just a bitcode translator to host machine code
    no memory protection
    no threads
    execution stack may only hold function continuation references and function local variables
    each CPU runs a main fiber scheduler
    all system and app work done via fibers

memory:
    physical addressing mode only
    garbage collection

dev language:
    no pointer assignments to constants
    no pointer arithmetic
    must emit reference maps per type for GC usage
        a simple bitmask describing which machine word offsets hold references
    function calling convention is continuation-passing-style
        multiple continuations passed for success/error handling

communication:
    only queues; several diff kinds of queues
    communication with drivers also done via queues
